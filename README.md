# ROS_Project(RR robot)
#### Using ROS to develop software for the motion of a robotic arm, which consists of two Revolute Joints, can be controlled in two ways. The first method utilizes a Potentiometer to control the rotation of Servomotor Axis 1 and an Encoder to control the rotation of Servomotor Axis 2 The second method controls the rotation of both servo motors using a GUI, with RViz displaying a 3D model of the robot's operation.
##### Software Requirement :
1. Ubuntu 20.04
2. ROS Noetic
3. Rosserial Arduino Library 0.7.9
4. Python3
5. Arduino IDE 1.8.15 
6. Tkinter GUI python library
